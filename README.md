Backbone Bootstrap 2014
==========================

This project is intended to have the folder structure that a Professional JavaScript Front End project should have, as
recommendation from the author.

The folder structure covers the "must have" in a JavaScript project:
* Source folders for JavaScript, CSS and HTML(view templates)
* Unit Tests
* Compiled folder
* Grunt setup
